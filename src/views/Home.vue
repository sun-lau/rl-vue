          <h3>Developed by Department of Applied Physics, PolyU</h3>
          <h6>Starting 2010, the Department of Applied Physics (AP) has launched a centralized depository of selected physics experiments. While the initial goal of the platform was for PolyU undergraduates admitted to APâ€™s service-teaching subjects, the idea has since gained popularity and is now also available for senior secondary school students.</h6>
