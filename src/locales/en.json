		"support_1_head":"Developed by Department of Applied Physics, PolyU",
		"support_1_message":"Starting 2010, the Department of Applied Physics (AP) has launched a centralized depository of selected physics experiments. While the initial goal of the platform was for PolyU undergraduates admitted to AP’s service-teaching subjects, the idea has since gained popularity and is now also available for senior secondary school students.",

		"support_3_message":"The RemoteLab project was awarded the 'Asia Gold Award' in the Wharton-QS Stars Reimagine Education 2016 Competition, for creating a novel, true-to-life remote laboratory to enhance student understanding of experimental methodologies and outcomes. The RemoteLab is the first-of-its-kind in Asia, and has enabled students to conduct experiments everywhere at all times."

		"description1":"The design of the experiment platform is illustrated in the figure below. Registered users can securely login to a server hosted in PolyU, which grants access to the interfacing control program in a local console. This local console is responsible for manipulating various components of the experiment setup, data acquisition from sensors and the signal transmission to the user. Real-time video monitoring is also facilitated to visualize the experiment ‘in action’.Background as well as supporting materials will be also provided for students.",
		"title2":"Benefits",
		"description2":"Highly flexible for adaptation in different learning and teaching modes (class demonstrations, individual/ group assignments, systematic investigations), as deemed suitable by instructors.\n\nStudents and/or teachers can operate such setups in a way similar to running the experiment in school laboratories, at any time and from everywhere (as long as internet access is available).\n\nAutomated data acquisition provides a scaffold for students to take and analyze a large number of good quality data, gives students a chance to learn how to analyze many data points and draw a reasonable conclusion based on such analysis."
